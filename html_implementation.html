                        <p class="regular px-3">This is a story of a software implementation. Carried out with passion and devotion. With no previous experience of people involved and no plan whatsoever. Just pure spontaneity. I still can't believe we actually did it. <br><br> The description below doesn't fully reflect all the effort and stress and difficulties we were facing during the implementation progress. But on the other hand that's not the point of this story. The point is to show You the adventure. And that was quite an adventure, I tell You... I would be honored if You read some more.</p>

                       <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">We need a software!</h4>
                        <p class="regular px-3">Once upon a time there was a popular museum in a big city with no integrated software to handle bookings, distribute souvenirs and tickets online, rent conference rooms, manage employees working hours, prepare sales reports... <br><br> A change needed to be done to make lifes of both employees an clients easier. Some sort of sales & booking application would be a breakthgrough, we thought, necessary to attract more visitors and to increase the work comfort of the tourist service team. But where do we start?</p> 
                    
                    </div>

                       <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">And we need people!</h4>
                        <p class="regular px-3">  No one really knew how to answer that question, me included. Yet my superiors trusted me and put me in charge of the whole project. So I coordinated it from the crazy beginnings till the relief-bringing end. 'I'm the one to praise or to blame', I thought. <br><br>It wouldn't be possible without the support of many friendly people, both co-workers and contractors, I met and worked with. We learned a lot from each other and about ourselves. First of all we found out we could more. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> The action took place not in the modern office of a leading IT company, somewhere on the 10th floor of a shiny scyscraper. It took place in a building which dates back to Middle Ages, in a museum whose sole purpose of existence is to preserve the past and display it to the people. <br><br> There were no scheduled dailies, no backlogs, no storypoints used, no sprints, no iterations, no retros... I'm not saying all of these had been redundant. I'm just saying I'm proud we managed without even realizing such things existed. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3">  We didn't have to do any research to recognize our needs. We knew exactly what had been missing. We wrote our requirements down one by one and invited some companies we found online to address them. <br><br> We looked through all the responses and decided wich one best suits our expectations. What was left was to buy a product according to all the legal requirements that bound a state-budget financed institution like the one I work for, prepare a contract, sign it and wait for the first software samples to come.</p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Softare finally come and the whole team needed to adapt quickly, as the expectations grew high. The process of testing and learning started. <br><br> At first most needed modules - administration, ticket booking, room rental, personnel management - were launched and soon all the data migrated from testing to production. We started working with the software for real.</p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Next step was to make online sale possible. First we built a website on our own but soon it occured a professional one is required. <br><br> The whole process of requirements' research, design company selection, sales programm integration, testing and training started over again. But finally the website was ready to launch. Both websites are to be seen: <a href="html_webdesign.html">here</a>.</p>
